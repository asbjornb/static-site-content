    <h1>Code that fits in your head</h1>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>Use checklists. For example for new projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create git repo</li>
<li>Automate unit tests+deployment</li>
<li>Enable warnings as errors for everything. Also nullability check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Isolate interaction/surface such as database calls/http requests etc. in slim classes with no business logic.</p>
<p>Encapsulation. Not so much about accessibility but more about guaranteeing objects can't be in invalid states. Using immutables and static constructors/constructers throwing exceptions are ways to accomplish this. Also Take care about primitive obsession - currency is much better than string, quantity is much better than decimal.</p>
<p>Can't fit too much complexity in short term memory. To allow easy understanding of code try to keep to a rule of 7. No more than 7 cyclomatic complexity, no more than 7 variables used inside method (parameters, locals, class fields), 20-30 max lines methods. Leads to fractal design. Each level has max 7 things going on - and each 7 subcomponents again has at most 7 things going on. When decomposing good ways to spot what to split include cohesion (which methods use which fields), validating/parsing, feature envy.</p>
<p>Build any vertical slice first - end to end. Http request to insertion of data in db even without validation/complete model etc.</p>
<p>Reproduce defects as tests. Any bug that makes it to production should result in an added test.</p>
<p>Api design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't allow illegal states.</li>
<li>Command/query separation</li>
<li>Don't use comments when method names suffice, don't use naming when types suffice.</li>
<li>Use types - avoid stringly api's.</li>
</ul>
