    <h1>Healthy food and body image in kids</h1>
<p>Inspired by Morten Elsøe and Anne Gaardmand (authors, podcasters)</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all - it's never too late to start good habits</li>
<li>Never speak weight, body type, diet with kids.
<ul>
<li>If you absolutely want to diet, keep it secret from them</li>
<li>Don't label anyone as thin/fat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never talk about some foods as healthy and some as unhealthy
<ul>
<li>This makes the unhealthy stuff just feel better for them and as a reward while the healthy will be seen as something they have to do so it can't possibly be good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never tell them to eat up
<ul>
<li>Their body will tell them when they're full if they haven't gotten too many bad habits already</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't let kids eat (anything but fresh veggies/fruit) while watching tv - but do absolutely let them play with their food</li>
<li>Once food is served stop exercising control on kids. If they want to eat the sweet stuff on their plate first or the meat first let them. If they want to sort the food let them. They are human beings and don't need being told how to eat</li>
<li>If you absolutely must limit some foods like chocolate, cereals etc. do it as &quot;hidden control&quot;. I.e. if they ask for chocolate say &quot;sure you can have some but we don't have any right now, let's buy it next time we go shopping&quot;</li>
<li>Allowing a one time dessert instead of dinner is much, much better than distorting their relationship with food. So in most cases better to allow something and then set it up better for next time.</li>
<li>No child was ever hurt by only eating say toast for one month. They will tire of it eventually or else see &quot;hidden control&quot;</li>
<li>Do give kids a plate with fresh veggies when they're tired and watching tv. It's a good way for them to get used to taste and consistency while mindlessly eating anyway</li>
<li>Never use candy as reward/punishment structures. Food is food and should not be used for anything else</li>
</ul>
